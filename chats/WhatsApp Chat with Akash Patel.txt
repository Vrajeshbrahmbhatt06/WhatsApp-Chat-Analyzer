12/09/23, 11:34 am - Akash Patel: Hey Neha, did you see the news about the latest Russian attacks in Ukraine? It's looking really bad...

12/09/23, 11:36 am - Neha Sharma: I know, it's so devastating. The war has been going on for over 6 months now. Those poor civilians stuck in the middle...

12/09/23, 11:38 am - Akash Patel: Yeah, it's horrific. And Putin still seems hell-bent on conquering Ukraine. The sanctions don't seem to be stopping him.

12/09/23, 11:40 am - Neha Sharma: I wonder how much longer this can go on? Ukraine is putting up such a strong fight but Russia has more military power.

12/09/23, 11:42 am - Akash Patel: I really hope Ukraine can prevail. But Russia keeps launching missile strikes on cities and power grids. Just ruthless.

12/09/23, 11:44 am - Neha Sharma: It's truly heartbreaking. I can't even imagine having to flee my home like that with nothing but the clothes on my back.

12/09/23, 11:46 am - Akash Patel: Me neither. Over 14 million Ukrainians have been displaced so far. The refugee crisis keeps growing.

12/09/23, 11:48 am - Neha Sharma: What a catastrophic failure of diplomacy this whole situation is. And now there are worries about Russia's nuclear threats.

12/09/23, 11:50 am - Akash Patel: I know, it's extremely concerning. If he gets desperate enough, who knows what he'll do. The world order feels so unstable.

13/09/23, 9:12 am - Neha Sharma: Hey! Did you hear Zelenskyy is asking for more advanced weapons from NATO?

13/09/23, 9:14 am - Akash Patel: Yeah, saw that. Guess Ukraine is trying to launch counteroffensives to take back territory.

13/09/23, 9:16 am - Neha Sharma: It's such a tough position though. If NATO provides heavier artillery, Russia may see it as an act of war.

13/09/23, 9:18 am - Akash Patel: Exactly, they have to tread carefully. This conflict is nowhere near over, 6 months later. Just devastating.

14/09/23, 12:34 pm - Akash Patel: Seems like Russia is having trouble sustaining its invasion forces according to intelligence reports.

14/09/23, 12:36 pm - Neha Sharma: Interesting. You mean supply chain issues and lack of equipment? Ukraine's resistance is clearly fierce.

14/09/23, 12:38 pm - Akash Patel: Yeah exactly, low troop morale too apparently. But Russia is still bombarding Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

14/09/23, 12:40 pm - Neha Sharma: Horrific. I really hope Ukraine can withstand the brutal winter conditions. This war needs to end.

15/09/23, 6:21 pm - Neha Sharma: Hey, did you see the UN General Assembly speeches? Zelenskyy spoke via video again.

15/09/23, 6:23 pm - Akash Patel: I didn't catch it but saw clips on Twitter. Anything noteworthy? I'm guessing he appealed for more aid?

15/09/23, 6:25 pm - Neha Sharma: Yeah he looked exhausted, asked for a special tribunal against Russia and more military assistance. Pretty powerful.

15/09/23, 6:27 pm - Akash Patel: That man is so resilient, you have to admire his courage. Meanwhile Putin is Doubling down on aggression.

15/09/23, 6:29 pm - Neha Sharma: Seriously. It's like no amount of condemnation deters him. Let's pray Ukraine sees justice someday soon. 🙏🏻

16/09/23, 11:04 am - Akash Patel: Hey, seems like the US announced another big military aid package for Ukraine yesterday?

16/09/23, 11:06 am - Neha Sharma: Yeah I saw that, $600 million worth! Guess they're sending more rocket systems and ammunition.

16/09/23, 11:08 am - Akash Patel: Much needed reinforcements by the looks of Russia's attacks lately. Hope this helps Ukraine regain territory.

16/09/23, 11:10 am - Neha Sharma: Me too, they need all the defensive weapons they can get. The destruction there just seems never-ending.

17/09/23, 9:45 pm - Neha Sharma: Hey, did you see this article about how the war is impacting global food shortages? https://www.un.org/en/observances/end-hunger-day

17/09/23, 9:47 pm - Akash Patel: I didn't read that one but it makes sense. Ukraine is one of the world's largest grain exporters. This war is harming so many beyond Ukraine.
