10/10/23, 9:30 pm - Neha Gupta: It's going to be the trip of a lifetime! Let's start looking for Airbnbs in each city.

10/10/23, 9:32 pm - Rhea Sharma: Good idea. Should we do 3 nights in each or mix it up? I'm leaning towards 3 everywhere.

10/10/23, 9:34 pm - Neha Gupta: Yeah 3 nights sounds good, enough time to see the sights without rushing too much.

11/10/23, 10:21 am - Rhea Sharma: Found some great Airbnb options for each city! Sending you links to look through.

11/10/23, 10:23 am - Neha Gupta: Checking now! These apartments are so cute. Love the ones with balconies and rooftop access.

11/10/23, 10:25 am - Rhea Sharma: I know right? And way cheaper than hotels! Should we go ahead and book them?

12/10/23, 7:47 pm - Rhea Sharma: Ooh May could work! The weather might be nicer too. Did you find direct flights?

12/10/23, 7:49 pm - Neha Gupta: Yup direct from Delhi to Barcelona then Venice to Paris etc. Want me to book?

13/10/23, 12:36 pm - Neha Gupta: Oooh smart idea! We can use it to plan out each city. Let me make one!

17/10/23, 9:45 am - Neha Gupta: Morning! Had a thought - should we learn some basic French and Italian phrases before the trip? Could be helpful!

17/10/23, 9:47 am - Rhea Sharma: That's a great idea! We should practice common travel phrases so we can navigate easily. Where should we start?

17/10/23, 9:49 am - Neha Gupta: I found some helpful YouTube videos for Italian and French phrases/conversation. Let's watch them together this weekend?

18/10/23, 8:12 pm - Rhea Sharma: 4 months to go! We should think about packing essentials so we're prepared. What do you think?

18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Neha Gupta: Great idea! We need to pack light and smart. I was thinking packing cubes? And phone chargers with adapters!

18/10/23, 8:16 pm - Rhea Sharma: Ooh yes, packing cubes are a must! And definitely adapters. comfort shoes too for all the walking we'll do!

18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Neha Gupta: Very true! I'll make a notes list on my phone of stuff to pack. This trip is going to be amazing!! 😍🤩

19/10/23, 12:38 pm - Neha Gupta: Perfect, I'm on it! Will send you options to review this weekend. Safety first so we should book private airport transfers too.

19/10/23, 12:40 pm - Rhea Sharma: Definitely, safety first! This trip planning has been so fun, 3 months feels so close. This is going to be the best girls trip!

20/10/23, 6:45 pm - Rhea Sharma: Hey! Came across a good Eurail pass deal for train travel between cities. Should we get it?

20/10/23, 6:47 pm - Neha Gupta: Oooh yes that would be perfect! Much easier than booking each leg separately. Is it a flexible pass?

20/10/23, 6:49 pm - Rhea Sharma: Yup! We can choose the travel dates and routes later no problem. And unlimited train rides for 2 weeks!
