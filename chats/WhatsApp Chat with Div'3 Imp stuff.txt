03/02/22, 10:17 pm - +91 94264 55118: Dear Students

We have completed one month of teaching and your attendance is uploaded on TCS. On going through your attendance record, I found that many students are not regular and there are students who have not attended even one lecture.

If your attendance is less than 80% percentage, I will either reduce your marks to penalize or I will grade your assignments out of 50% of the total marks allotted for the assignments. Moreover, if such students do not submit assignments on time, they will not be given a second chance to submit.

I will be very strict when it comes to attendance, submission of assignments on time and grading the assignments. If such students fail, I will entertain no request or accept explanation from them.

This mail is sent with a copy to your Head of Department, Dr. Samir Patel.

The Roll Numbers of students who are very irregular are given below:
19, 21, 27, 40, 44, 47, 50, 56, 63, 87, 93, 102, 119, 133, 145, 154, 160, 177, 180, 200, 229, 233, 243, 244, 249, 269, 274, 280, 293, 322D, 324D, 326D, 19BCP074

So sir decided that if you want to do projects related to applications of various algorithm taught to us in this semester in various domains you can do it on individual basis i.e. It will not a part of our lab work. BUT THE BASE FOR PROJECT WILL BE APPLICATIONS OF ALGORITHMS.

Sir will shortly create a team and joining code for the same will be shared and do join the team if you are willing to do and complete this research project.

17/08/22, 5:48 pm - Manav Ukani, PDPU: Other option is to change the port of MySQL Xampp from 3306 to something else(like 3308).

Procedure:

Here is how to do it :

1. Open Xampp.

2. Stop all the running Xampp services.

3. Go to "config" at the top-right corner of the Xampp window, click on "service and port settings", go to "mysql" tab and change the "main port" to 3308 or something else.

4. Now, in Xampp, click on "config" in the MySql row (click on MySql's "config"), and open "my.ini".

5. "my.ini" will open in notepad. Go to line 20 (Can be some other line also) and change the port to 3308, like this:

# password = your_password

port = 3308

…

6. Also, change the port to 3308 on line 28 of my.ini file, like this:

# The MySQL server

[mysqld]

port= 3308

…

7. Save the changes.

8. Restart the Xampp(If you are still not able to start the MySql service, restart your computer.)

You have successfully changed the MySql port, BUT WAIT, there is something else you need to do.

9. Now go to C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin (Your directory where Xampp is installed. It can be different for your computer, depends on where you have installed the Xampp). Open the "config.inc.php" file.

10. Below the user, password and extension lines at the top of the file(below line 23), add this line:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = 3308;

(If you don't follow step 10, this error will occur while opening "PhpMyAdmin": (HY000/2002): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)

11. Save the changes.

12. Also, from now, in your every new project, you will have to mention this new port in your project code. Here is an example :

//After changing the port:

//Connecting Mysql Database with PHP:

$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost:3308" , "root" , "", "database_name");

The first parameter/argument of mysqli_connect is now localhost:3308, instead of localhost.

There will be 15 multiple-choice questions and each question will be carrying 1 mark. And the exam duration is 10 minutes. It may be extended in case you have an internet connectivity problem. Also, I am attaching the PDF for unit 1 only.

25/05/23, 12:40 pm - Khush Shah, PDPU: Dear Students,

I hope this email finds you well. For all the students (In-house + Industry) inhouse mentor is compulsory. So you have to fill the choice of their In-house mentor by *today evening till 5PM*. If the student is selected in the industry for the internship till 01/06/23, they can switch to the industry internship.

For the inhouse internship, student has to take consent from faculty before providing his/her name as mentor. 
There is upper cap on the maximum number of groups assign to each mentor, so final mentor allocation may change ( Mostly in Industry Internship).
 In case of any query, feel free to call me.

https://forms.office.com/r/a3ibkrnq3G

Best wishes
Dr. Rajeev Kumar Gupta

25/05/23, 1:51 pm - Maharshi Pandya, PDPU: In a nutshell, the formalities are as the following:-

Inhouse mentor needs to be selected, irrespective of industry or in-house (To be done before today 5PM, do the entry in https://pdpuacin-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/rajeev_gupta_pdpu_ac_in/EYVpsCgMpIlMkoC3tEEsfW8BjP3P62OEBfVD-8ZvQMshKg?rtime=_RUi_e9c20g)

The form has to be filled for the records by all the students (To be done before 31st of May)
25/05/23, 1:51 pm - Maharshi Pandya, PDPU: what is this? roll number wise fill karvanu che?
25/05/23, 1:56 pm - Khush Shah, PDPU: If you are doing in-house internship then you have to concern respective faculty member 
But if you are working in industry( oncampus/offcampus) then you can directly put any faculty member's name in the above sheet without concerning him/her. 
So everyone has to fill this form !

29/08/23, 12:32 pm - Neh Patel, PDPU: Subject: Urgent: Unforeseen Change in IoT Internal Assessment Exam Date

Hello Ma'am

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the sudden change in the examination date for the Internal Assessment Exam of the Internet of Things (IoT) course.

On Saturday, we were informed by Mr. Ketan.Sabale that the IoT Internal Assessment Exam was scheduled for September 5th. Based on this information, many of us made arrangements to travel home for a festival celebration, believing that we had ample time to prepare and return for the exam.

However, to our utmost surprise, on Sunday, Mr. Ketan.Sabale announced that the exam has been rescheduled to August 29th (Tuesday). This abrupt change in the exam date has caused considerable confusion and inconvenience to many of us who had already left the hostel and traveled home for the festival.

While we understand that circumstances can change, we believe that students should be given reasonable notice for such crucial matters, especially when they require adjustments to travel plans and preparation schedules. Changing the exam date without providing us with at least a week's notice has put us in a challenging situation, as we now have limited time to travel back to the college and adequately prepare for the exam.

We kindly request your intervention in this matter to ensure fairness and transparency in the academic process. It is our sincere hope that such situations can be avoided in the future, and students can be given sufficient time to adjust their plans accordingly.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could address this issue with the faculty members involved and establish a protocol to ensure that students are notified of any changes to important academic dates well in advance. This proactive approach will not only alleviate unnecessary stress but also promote a more efficient and effective learning environment.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

Sincerely,

29/08/23, 1:03 pm - Neh Patel, PDPU: Hello Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the scheduling of the upcoming IoT Internal Assessment Exam.

On Saturday, you informed us that the exam would take place on September 5th. Based on this information, a number of students, including myself, made arrangements to leave the hostel and return home to celebrate the festival. However, we were surprised to learn on Sunday that the exam has been rescheduled to August 29th, which is this Tuesday.

This sudden change in the exam date has put several of us in a difficult situation. As we are not at the hostel currently and are away from the necessary study materials and resources, attending the exam on August 29th would be extremely challenging for us. We have made travel plans and are not in a position to return to the hostel in such a short notice.

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes lead to changes in schedules, but I kindly request that you consider the predicament that this change has put us in. Given the circumstances, I would like to request that you please consider rescheduling the exam to a later date, one that would allow all students, including those currently away from the hostel, to adequately prepare and participate.

Rescheduling the exam to a date after our return to the hostel would ensure that we can give our best performance and fulfill our academic responsibilities without any unnecessary stress or inconvenience. I am sure many of my fellow students who are in a similar situation would greatly appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter.

Thank you for taking the time to read my email, and I hope we can find a suitable solution that accommodates the needs of all students involved. I eagerly await your response and guidance on how to proceed.

Sincerely,
Neh Patel

I know that none of us are prepared, so sir suggested that if very few or no people come in class i.e mass bunk he would shift exam to next class. Thursday for division 1 and 3 and Monday for division 2 and 4. Hence today try to refrain from going to data intelligence class. Division 2,3,4 are already in sync with idea of mass bunk. Everyone please support mass bunk so that exam shifts to next date.

A. In a Confusion Matrix, actual values should be put in rows, while predicted values should be placed in columns. This arrangement helps to clearly distinguish between the different outcomes of a classification model. Rows typically represent the actual classes (e.g., True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives), and columns represent the model's predictions for those classes. This format aids in calculating various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

B. Precision and Recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in situations with imbalanced datasets:

   - Precision: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by a model. It is calculated as the ratio of True Positives (correctly predicted positive cases) to the sum of True Positives and False Positives (all predicted positive cases). Precision = TP / (TP + FP).

   - Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): Recall measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of a positive class. It is calculated as the ratio of True Positives to the sum of True Positives and False Negatives (all actual positive cases). Recall = TP / (TP + FN).

C. The True Positive Rate is synonymous with Recall. In this case, the recall is given as 80%, which means Recall = 0.80.

D. Let's calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-score for the scenario of catching fish and rocks in a net:

   - True Positives (TP): 80 (fish caught)
   - False Positives (FP): 80 (rocks caught)
   - False Negatives (FN): 20 (fish missed, since there were 100 total fish)
   
   Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 80 / (80 + 80) = 0.5 or 50%
   Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 80 / (80 + 20) = 0.8 or 80%

   F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of a model's performance:

   F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   F1-score = 2 * (0.5 * 0.8) / (0.5 + 0.8) = 0.615 or approximately 61.5%

In this scenario, the Precision is 50%, the Recall (True Positive Rate) is 80%, and the F1-score is approximately 61.5%. These metrics help assess the net's effectiveness in catching fish while minimizing the number of rocks caught.
